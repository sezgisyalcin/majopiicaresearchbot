- Linguistics (Italian phonology, pronunciation, historical linguistics, neurolinguistics)
- Meta-academic tools (reading lists, methodology, theory maps, where to publish)
- Official global weather (WMO / NMHS)

This package is intentionally structured so you can:
- Add new academic sources without touching code
- Expand to new countries or disciplines
- Deploy directly on Railway
